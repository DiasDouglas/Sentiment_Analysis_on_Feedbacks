"One of the better Unreal courses by far! I bought this course when it originally released. I never completed it before (nothing to do with the quality of the first iteration, I was really enjoying the content, just had school and work tearing me apart and I fell off) but recently I started coding again and took the semester off so I decided to go back through it. I already knew my way around Unreal a little bit before starting, but I take every chance I get to try and learn more, and you guys managed to teach me more. I've made it through a few other courses before and they're never really informative (""Alright, this is how you do this, this, and this. Give this thing a value of 5.f. Now call ThisFunctionYouWouldHaveNeverBeenAbleToFigureOut, make sure to include its header 'YadaYada/GoodLuckWhenYoureOnyourOwn.h'. Okay, great. Let me show you something else now."") You guys really did a great job actually teaching instead of showing how to just copy code. I really love that there's almost always a challenge in each lecture, and that's honestly the thing that no one else seems to do. Now I'm super excited to meet back up with Michael to do his Blender course that I bought years ago as well. Cheers, guys!"
"The course has taught me every basics of the Engine and its features as well as programming in C++. Edit: As mentioned before I'm very sad that I didn't have to see Ben teaching in the updated version of the course. He was the one who explained to me all the basic things that I was struggling with. After that I went through the whole updated course, but because Ben has taught me everything I needed to understand the concept of the Engine I had no problem to do all the challenges by myself. Also shout out to Sam Pattuzzi for also good presentations."
I needed some information to understand how to start with Unreal Engine and this course was very useful for this.
"Offers fantastic coverage of the Unreal Engine and its version of C++. The tutors are very good at pacing and explaining everything they are doing to ensure you do not miss something, or fail to understand why things work the way they do. There is a lot to take in and remember, but they offer consistent challenges every video to get you to practice what you have learnt. These things are often applied again at later stages as refreshers. I highly recommend this course for both beginners and intermediates. I look forward to trying their other courses! :)"
Overall a good course. It can be fast paced sometimes and some topics can and should be explained more. I almost gave up during toon tanks. The skill level seems to jump too much in between that and the section before it.
"Great course, having originally purchased this just shy of two years ago, it's been updated since then with many improvements and better explanations being provided."
"The second to last section of this course is NOT beginner friendly as the instructor just kind of throwing terminologies and new concepts at you, but the contents are still valid. It would be the best to watch the last section before the second last section if you never worked with C++ before as the last section is more detailed and slower paced. Also, just personally speaking, I think Sam's and Mikey's voices are great as a instructor: energetic and ethusiastic, the other instructor's voice & tone kind of making me sleepy throughout his lectures. Overall the course is good introductary course, if the aforementioned section could be improved, this can be a 5 star course."
Overall excellent course. I am an experienced c/c++ programmer that was looking to expand my skill set into Unreal Engine and I enjoyed the course. I would say my only disappointment was in the last part of the updated escape game module. The video is a sped up version of the level being built. I would have liked to see a bit more of what went into the design of that level since it was more intricate than the basic room used to teach everything else in the module.
"Really makes you listen. Very well organizational teaching, good audio quality. Like a tutorial with an Oscar. The fourth and fifth sections however felt rushed and the instructors aren't as professional, skipping important instructions, not speaking of what they're doing as they're doing them and such."
"The overall quality of the course is very good, but there are some fundamental missing items in the later courses (slides, explanations, and potential uses outside of the immediate project) that really hurts the overall experience. On my re-watch of this course, I've flipped the Simple Shooter and the Toon Tanks class so I can properly grasp the concepts."
"Excellent tutorial for most parts except for ""ToonTank"" tutorial, going too fast and explanations are unclear. Other parts are well-paced and well-explained."
This was a great course that helped me immensely. Each section was well thought out aside from the Toon Tanks Section which needs a lot of work to get to the same level of quality as the others. With that being said it was a very good course that gave me easily accessible information that I am excited to use in my future projects!
"Overall, a good introduction to UE and C++ with up to date instructions and examples. Would be nice if you could add an example for pickups (health etc) and multiple levels."
"As all of GameDev.tv this is good course. Introduction of the new instructor in ToonTanks section lowers my opinion of the course as a whole though :(. That one section is hectic, feels rushed, voice over is somehow disconnected to what is happening on the screen (and feels really flat). I don't know what happened here as his youtube tutorial are of much higher quality."
Change my rating. Leasons are good. Sometimes support really slow and do not read carefully what you write. So best way to solve all by yourself. But mainly course are good.
"Really thorough and enjoyable course, packed with a variety of information and content! I learned a lot and found the tutors engaging and knowledgeable. Thanks!"
"First I want to say I think this was a fine course and I have been a big fan of other GameDev.TV team and courses for a while. I have completed the Unity 2D, Unity 3D, and Unity RPG, and most of the Blender courses. I was hoping this course would be similar but in my opinion this course was not as well fleshed out as the Unity courses. I felt like this course relied more heavily on built in code rather than teaching how we could make our own classes. While the course does provide some of the information it just did not seem as well done as the Unity courses were. Hopefully there will be a new Unreal course in the future that is closer in scale and educational value to the Unity courses."
"This course is a good entry point to Unreal Engine. It starts slowly due to TripleX and Bulls&Cows, so initially I was a little bit disappointed...BuildingEscapes and above all ToonTanks (short but detailed) and SimpleShooter (the best lesson) drastically changed this feeling into a positive one."
"This course has helped me pretty much to fundamentally understand how to work with Unreal Engine. Instructors are good and has a pace you easily can follow and they explain some things good so you understand.

I left a star out because, at least in simple shooter, some minor bugs occurs but is never showed in the lecture. Therefore they are never really resolved at spot or told why it's happening, some issues will be solved at a later lecture. I would love if they could have told just that, instead of thinking the issue only occurs for me, being confused and spend some unnecessary time on backtracking.

- An example that I myself could solve quickly was AI's focus in blueprint. The AI's rotation snaps its rotation in a jittery way. This was really never shown during that lecture and I saw at least one being stuck on that. Something I got stuck on being confused was when the enemy died, the corpse still rotates and follow you. Also here, never really shown and so, never brought up solved or explained at spot. I had playtested the final result so I blindly hoped it would be solved at a later lecture. -

These are some small things I understand can be hard to miss. I would however suggest for the instructor/s to properly playtest each new thing implemented just to spot such things. Also maybe a future edit on these videos to pause and explain these stuff one way or another, as some older lectures have."
"As an absolute beginner, I learned a lot and I am ready to learn from more complex resources now. Most of the course explaines every step in great detail with lots of challenges, but towards the end, it becomes a lot of ""just write what I write and it will work"" with little explanation of why that is. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn to use c++ in unreal engine."
Thanks for the course. I have learned a lot of new things. Something has to be done of toon tank course because it for that course tutor is speaking over the video so it makes it difficult to understand. Other portions are perfect!
"I gave a 5-star review at first until I got to the ToonTanks section which is supposed to explain some of the most important aspects of UE4 and C++ and it's failing at both. I'm not a beginner and been coding for a while so I just can imagine how confusing it is for a beginner to understand and follow.

Still a very good course but I was hoping Ben and his colleagues to have mastered their project-based teaching style after years of running Gamedev.tv and Udemy courses, but unfortunately, that is not the case."
"As someone who already programed a little in c++, made small and simple game in UE4 with blueprints (but no UE4 C++), can say that this course filled my need for some practice with UE4 C++ combo, first two sections wasn't very useful for me because they barely touched Unreal aspects, also got some problems with Wraith asset pack, I was forced to download the oryginal asset from unreal marketplace and improvise, otherwise everything was great;

ToonTanks was my favorite section, dunno why people complain about it;"
"For an experienced programmer wanting to learn about Unreal video game making, but who usually suffers when trying to use new interfaces, this is perfect, as long as you skip the first project which is just C++ intro. You'll get quick fundamental refreshers that you can easily skip if you feel confident and then they'll tell you all about UE specific stuff to get you started much more easily than any free online tutorials I could find. Very well constructed course, cool projects along the way! Thank you for this great work."
"This course is great. I enjoy all lessons. But the instructor for the ""Toontanks"" section is going a bit fast and gives few details at some point."
"It's heavy stuff! I'm trying to follow along as a newcomer to coding and Game Developing. I'm very passionate about this, so I think I will continue my education all the way through."
"Very well defined examples, I liked how small parts built on each other [especially in the Shooter game] and the documentation or the underlying engine code is quite often shown for your further research.

1. If you follow along like me, continuously pausing (and rewinding) the video, and writing the code, a dual monitor setup could be helpful.

2. When Unreal Engine denies to load your project the error is ALWAYS in you C++ code, none of the file deletion magic helped!"
"What an outstanding introduction to Unreal Engine! I started with a solid knowledge of programming, and had used C++ many years ago. I knew nothing about Unreal Engine and this course did a great job of getting me to the point of being comfortable making my own games now. I really appreciated that there was lots of hands-on work to try things and mini-challenges in each lecture.

I'd say if you don't already know C++, this course isn't really going to teach it to you. You will learn just enough to follow along, but I recommend taking a dedicated C++ course either before or after this one if you plan to do more serious programming."
"Really great course! If you have a background in C/C++ already, you can safely skip past Triple X - I watched it in its entirety and while it provides a fantastic overview of the language, it's very much beginner focused.

The courses are structured in a very easy to follow way, with convenient break points and challenges to test the concepts discussed throughout the lectures. Even though there are multiple instructors, the different projects flow together nicely and everything is easy to follow.

My only critique would be that I found myself wanting more theory (blackboarding sessions) and less copy and paste code in certain areas. In particular, the later projects cover some fairly complex topics (state machines, animations, AI, etc.), and I would have almost preferred a 15 minute lecture explaining high level theory and how the different components fit together, their nested hierarchy and inheritance, other uses and possibilities, etc. That being said, there were very many of these blackboarding sessions, and I found them to be the most valuable information in those sections of the projects.

Overall, fantastic course! I could easily recommend this to people of varying code experience. Enjoyable and educational!"
"Great course! I'm really thankful for the instructors teaching the course, as I've learned a whole lot about Unreal Engine 4 from scratch.

- Bulls&Cows felt like an ""HelloWorld"" for Unreal Engine and it was really nice to experience a whole new development environment.

- The EscapeRoom part really did great job explaining about Unreal and giving a good overview on all of the tools available.

- ToonTanks was great also and gave a good understanding about the deeper connections of the classes and a little about Blueprints.

- SimpleShooter did a great job of taking all of the knowledge of the course and putting it all into one last project, which in my opinion was really really fun.

I really liked the fact that the instructors don't just go about doing it all, and give simple yet challenging tasks for you to do yourself.

All being said, the tools which I've achieved will help me in my journey towards game development and I really feel like it helped me start with the right foot.

Thanks again! :)"
"Excellent Pacing for most sections, topics were(for the most part) well covered, then reiterated enough to make things better. The website and surrounding community support (through discord, the forums, and submitting completed/in progress work for review by community/teaching assistants) was amazing and very helpful."
This can be improved. Like showing each code with blueprint and by comparing them to visually tell what each code does to better understand.
"Hi, Amazing course. I would only suggest that the Toon Tanks Section should be redone in the same style as the other courses. It was very much a ""Look how much I know and how fast I can do everything"" experience instead of a learning experience. The Lecturer went so fast that it was at times difficult to pause the video to take in what he had typed as he transitioned away too quickly leaving a gap nearly impossible to navigate back to in the navbar of the video.

On a side note anyone who felt like Toon Tanks was such a large jump forward from the previous sections that you will not be able to continue, just power through the next section is a lot better."
Best begginer's course. I can reccomend this course to anyone who is intrested in learning Unreal Engine.
"I enjoyed it a lot, covers an incredibly large amount of content. This was super informative for someone with very little C++ knowledge but lots of blueprint knowledge. There were a few moments where I felt they weren't teaching the best programming practices but those were rare and were usually patched with paused commentary where the instructor notes the proper way to do things that will be fixed later in videos. There were times where videos assumed that content had been covered (mostly in the Tank section) and required a lot of individual research. While I'm writing down several things I wish to see improved, I rated this virtually 5 stars for a reason. This is an excellent resource for getting started. I would highly recommend this course for people who already have a decent understanding of Unreal and the blueprint system but it might be a bit overwhelming for absolute beginners (not impossible though)."
"The remastered UE-4.25 version of the course is perfect. Teaching is very efficient especially ToonTanks and SimpleShooter.

I had missed out on Sam's older version of SimpleShooter as it was archived. Now the Remastered Version seems to be great with AAA Styled Detailed Assets.

Rob being a new addition is very very knowledgeable and efficient with the coding logic and organization. His ToonTanks section is short and concise and filled with information that can act as a solid foundation to any game. I would suggest making note of everything taught by him in each lecture.

I had gone through the BattleTanks section which is currently a part of the Archive, it wasn't perfect but it did teach a lot of things about Unreal. I would suggest people to check it out. It's worth the trouble.

And also please check the Q&A tab when going through each lecture. There is a hidden gem named Daniel, who is very bright and helps you out with Alternative Implementations, Resolving Issues, Pointing out the nuances with Unreal and any clarification needed on any topic."
"There are two really bad things about this course. First one - is that it will most probably take you more than 30 days (money-back period) to realize that you're not learning something but rather just copying what various people are typing on their screens. Second one - realizing that losing a couple of months is way worse than wasting 10-20 bucks.

I was really excited about it but it's just pure disappointment. Like I said earlier, most of the time you're just staring at the screen watching how someone is coding something. So briefly:

Bulls and Cows: Though the project was indeed very boring and (can I repeat it again?) extremely boring - I did like Michael's way of teaching, his excitement when talking about some stuff etc. He was alive and engaged, sometimes laughing, sometimes saying funny things which is very important. You could feel he's alive person that cares about stuff he's doing. It could have been (maybe) completely different course if led by Michael alone from start to finish as I liked the way he was presenting his stuff. But briefly - you will not learn much in this course as it's just some text/command line type of game which is very specific.

Building Escape: Good one. I learned some things but for the majority of times I had no idea what and why I was doing it this or that way and was just copying stuff mostly.

ToonTanks: The point when I realized I've had enough of bs. I would name this section ""I don't care if you're following or not guys, I'm going to do type my stuff quickly and the rest is your problem"". Rob Brook might be the greatest programmer in the world but obviously a disaster as a teacher. Almost everything he did was either unexplained or explained in the worst and unclear way. At some point I just realized I'm just copying blindly what he is doing on the screen as he wasn't explaining what's going on assuming it is clear the way it is. So briefly: boring voice, unenthusiastic/exhausted, and not being so kind and generous to take a minute and explain what's going on."
"Excellent course, covering lots of different aspects of creating a game with unreal, good support and very enjoyable. Would highly recommend if you want to get into building games. I certainly feel I can now create the basis of fairly complex games. Thanks."
"As someone who has used C# in Unity, there are some aspects that carried over which may have given me a headstart for the course that may deem this review as a bit biased compared to a newcomer. The course was great in my opinion, the initial sections were great in teaching newcomers to C++ (like myself) about coding conventions which aren't in other coding languages (C#, JS, etc.) as well as good coding practices which can be carried over to other coding languages (refactoring as an example). I've encountered a few issues (mainly the Toon Tanks) but overall was a great experience. Where the course really stood out for me was the Simple Shooter section which was what I really came for in the long run. Overall this is a 5/5 course and was well worth the 31 hours and would easily recommend this course to someone wanting to start in Unreal/C++."
The course was mostly fine except for the ToonTank section. That section alone made me start looking through other tutorials on Udemy for Unreal Engine to see if there was a better one. Prepare to be totally and completely lost as the instructor flies through the code while narrating a stream of thought without really explaining how any of the functions and variable types they're calling really work.
"I am currently in Section 5, Video 148. Its going pretty good so far and I can understand most of it pretty nicely, however I will go watch the old videos again and practice what I learnt before moving on to section 6.

The only minor issue I had with the course is that at certain points, especially Section 5, the speaker goes very fast, almost like a robot. Section 4 had a much slower speaker who I could understand better and clearly. I am new to udemy and I dont think it has an option to slow the playback speed.

Other than this, the course itself is really good. The speakers pin point the few bugs and issues that the engine currently faces which can be really helpful. I also liked the spiral teaching method, since I practice what I learnt and then again go watch the old videos where I had certain problems with.

Overall, a really good course to get you up with the basics of this engine. I got it for a very cheap price as it was for sale, and I did not expect it to be so good."
"It's a tough course if you don't grasp the concepts early on and be able to create a mental image of what is what and how the language flows. Hopefully with the remaster that is being made, it will be a lot easier to follow the course (Less time troubleshooting Unreal bugs) due to the difference in the Unreal Engine version used in the video vs the current version."
"Very good, I enjoyed it a lot. Lots of learning to do, instructors explain stuff quite well. Plus with a new update to the course, you have a very nice first person shooter game to make which you could actually play. So definitely recommend this course."
"Really glad they changed the course from what it originally was. The old courses were good and they taught quite a bit but the tank one in particular was an absolute mess. Funny, in hindsight. The new lectures are shorter but much tighter and none of them force the editor to crash anymore which is great. I do miss the more advanced stuff from the older course but this new is definitely far better suited to beginners. 5*"
"The quiz are pretty pointless. No need to do bulls & cows in Unreal since it creates more confusion. Content coverage is odd, nothing about animation and very little about AI."
"Very good introductory course on C++ with Unreal Engine 4. Ben in particular is a phenomenal instructor. Mikey and Sam were a close second though. Sam just needs to tell us what he's doing a bit more while he's doing it. I am definitely doing more courses with GameDev.TV, very good team I believe."
I've worked with Unity / C# previously and wanted a quick introduction to UE. This course was really useful for that - the ToonTanks section was more of a speed-run but the rest of the course was paced and scoped really well. Personally I would have liked some deeper info on C++ but that's easy to find elsewhere and might overwhelm someone who is new to programming in general. Thanks!
"Really detailed and I love it :)

Edited: The Toon Tank section so far is really confusing. Need to rewatch each lecture for at least 3 times and google at the same time:(. The Bull&Cow and Escape were really detailed and easy to understand that I usually put 1.5 speed no problem. While in Toon tank I am putting it at 1.0 and need to google everything to understand ""Why"" we are using some function/creating classes.

And yeah after spending whole afternoon on ToonTank, I can only reach to lecture 141 with lots of confusion :(.

Currently on lecture 152. If the previous lectures are considered as ""hard to understand"", then this one is totally mess. We havent learnt those complex graph at all :(

Added one star for Simple Shooter section, much much better"
"Great course that goes step by step through most of the needed topics for game development in Unreal. The course is structured well and builds upon previously learned topics. Rather than show a polished solution from the beginning, some of the lectures start with an issue (some appear to be unintentional) that is addressed in the same or future lectures. The material is currently being remastered, but I was able to complete everything including the older Battle Tank in Unreal 4.24."
"The course started off really great, explained in detail unreal engine and the unreal editor. The initial projects are great and fun to work on, the instructor meticulously and painstakingly explained every little detail.

When you reach Section 5:ToonTanks, the instructor seems to be in a rush to finish the project without really explaining the reasons of many of his decisions. You end up watching another person code and design without grasping any fundamentals."
"Outstanding content by amazing instructors! I really needed this high quality education since learning C++ in Unreal is difficult with little documentation (but is so powerful).

They continue to update the course with content and to explain some concepts better. Questions are answered quickly."
"(Edited Review after passing the ""Toon Tanks"" section and moving onto ""Simple Shooter""). The starting tasks and sections are really good for absolute beginners that gets you comfortable with the engine and how to work simple things, which was good, and watching at 1.25x meant that I wasnt getting bored. However the Toon Tanks section was really weak, and I almost gave up the course, however be strong! Once finished the simple shooter section is fantastic, the teacher is really confident and explainations are spot on with just the right amount of depth for my understanding, allowing us to keep moving onto the next thing"
"information packed, and great paced. Love that there is a discussion website where I can get help at least once a day if needed. Also love that this course is updated regularly! definitely would recommend this course to anyone interested in coding."
"The way this course teaches you how to code is better than all the coding course I had on Udemy so far ..

Ok I have to edit the review, the content from the ToonTank section is great, but the lecturer definitely went way too fast and assumed you know a lot on C++ and blueprint. I had some experince Unity before so was acceptable for me but it would be pretty hard for someone new to C++ and didn't have much programming experience, which are the target audience of this course I suppose?"
Great way to start learning c++ with unreal but if you're looking to learn how to build a game from scratch look elsewhere
"I do have some coding experience, though I am completely new to C++. The instructors are doing a great job of keeping things clear and concise; with solid explanations of the nuances."
I find the course very good but the instructor does move to fast with the mouse sometimes to see what he is selecting.
"I learned the Unreal Engine way of C++ coding. Learned many resourceful concepts of C++ that I will use in my current projects. I had a basic understanding of C++ beforehand, which made the concepts easier to understand. For some people, like me, coding is difficult, but I'm glad I stuck with it and took this course. It was very rewarding.

Cons: I took the last section (Battle Tank) while they were updating the course, so there are differences in the new engine versions that you will have to sort out. I was living in the Q&A for some problems. I'm sure once they update the course fully, it will be better.

Thank you for putting this together! Appreciate all your work."
"This course is great right up until you hit the Toon Tanks section and then a big drop in teaching quality happens. A new instructor is introduced who obviously has a lot of experience with unreal/c++, but clearly is not on the same teaching level as the previous instructor. The instructor for the previous sections really tries to explain why things are being done. When you arrive at Toon Tanks, the instructor jumps right in and you basically just watch a guy make a game and copy paste. To put it simply the content goes from trying to be a course to a being a tutorial once you hit Toon Tanks. I read that the fps section is better so I will update this review if i can slog through the Toon Tanks."
"This course is mostly very in-depth and thorough, although some things, especially in the last 2 sections are not explained very thoroughly."
The course is what I expected. I like the way the instructors are explaining and I hope I can make some amazing things using C++ and Unreal Engine. Great work on these courses. Keep up the awesome work
"This course was very informative. It helped me to build a strong foundation in Unreal and C++. The explanations were concise and clear. I liked the fact that the instructor didn't provide the final or best solutions to the challenges upfront. Instead, through the process of refactoring the solution (although tedious at times), it demonstrated the natural progression towards a maintainable and efficient solution. Valuable lessons were learnt during this process.

Excellent course! I look forward to your future courses."
This is really the best course for Unreal and I highly recommend everybody to do this course as a basic foundation for the unreal Engine. With all the debugging and I have picked up some nice workarounds. I have learned so much and even though it was a slow process it was very well explained and many thanks to Ben Triston and the team.
Thanks for teaching me about Unreal. I think I have become extremely familiar with common bugs (mine and the engine's). I hope I'll put all the knowledge that you transferred me to good use. Thanx again.
"just slightly slow moving since i've got some code background already, but mostly great! Continuing into building escape things pick up faster, which is nice."
"This Course HAS BEEN WONDERFUL! IM LOVING IT! of course, I still don't know all the syntax for Unreal, but I will learn it in time! This course takes me step-by-step to learn the purpose of each function and syntax! Absolutely loving it! Love you Game Dev. Really interested in taking a blender course later, but this has been a great start!"
"The instructors are very knowledgeable and helpful. I learned very fast in a comparatively short amount of time. The newer sections they have updated feel a little bit rushed in comparison to the first couple of sections. They do show you how to solve your own mistakes, but sometimes it gets a bit confusing as they troubleshoot and cleanup in the middle of a lesson."
"That was a really good experience, especially I liked first three parts with Mike, he explained everything very clear and I could understand everything. But maybe my knowledge is very poor and I didn't get ToonTanks and SimpleShooter parts well. I tried to google everything and it took enormous amount of time, while Mike explained everything on the go."
"This is a great course to start developing inside the unreal engine and learn the basics of C++. Every lecture is focusing on one aspect to further and further develop your skills. :-)

UPDATE: Section 5 is a bit hard to follow along. I understand the topic and the things which the instructor is doing, but it would be pretty good if he could explain things a little bit slower and make it better to understand for ""beginners"". :-) Overall until now still a great course."
"This may sound stupid, but the idea of the bull and cow game got me confused. We dont have this kind of game in my country and it was a complicated concept to understand. Other than that the course is great!"
I have just started a Graduate Software Developer position at a games studio and need to learn Unreal. This course has been a perfect introduction to the engine. It has allowed me to start learning game development by making use of my existing C++ skills and will be invaluable in my career.
"I agonized about changing my rating on this course, because clearly so much work went into it, but as it is, after completing approximately half of the course, I unfortunately had to edit my review.

The course starts off strong giving you a solid foundation of learning C++ syntax with a simple text game. The first instructor did a very good job of taking things at an easy pace and making you feel confident as you understand more and more about coding. I was able to complete every challenge presented in Section 1 without skipping ahead. 5 stars hands down if the rest of this course went as smoothly as Section 1 did with TripleX. But then the trouble began with the Bull Cow Game in Section 2, taught by Michael Bridges.

Clearly Michael knows his stuff, is an excellent programmer, and he's a good speaker. But teaching someone else what you know is an entirely different skill. Also, the Bull Cow Game is already constructed as a ""starter kit"" and I think this is a huge mistake. Building it from scratch would have had IMMENSE educational value, despite making the tutorial significantly lengthier. Michael zips around changing code, moving entire lines of code, introducing new functions, new commands, new terms you haven't heard before, and putting code in specific areas of the file you're working on ALL without explaining any of it. It has truly frustrated me to no end, and whatever enthusiasm I had for learning C++ in Unreal was completely and utterly evaporated once Michael began teaching. I found myself constantly pausing and rewinding the videos, unable to do a single challenge since Michael began teaching. As a beginner, it shattered my confidence. I begrudgingly forced myself to power on through Section 2, hoping that perhaps Section 3 Building Escape would be better.

At first, it was better, and I instantly enjoyed manipulating 3D objects, lighting, and texturing. And I was able to follow along with what Michael was talking about (mostly). But soon enough, once Blueprints were introduced, he began zipping around using Multiply and Append nodes without explaining what those nodes do or why he used them. Then he revisited coding to rotate a door and introduced ""floats"" (which wasn't explained at all) and I was totally lost once again.

This course could definitely be a 5-star course. But as it stands, it's done little more than frustrate and dishearten me as I struggle to understand the instructor's jargon and why I'm typing what I'm typing into Visual Studio Code (and more importantly, WHY I'm putting it in the place that I am).

I think the Gamedev team would really benefit from having a TRUE beginner (like myself) with no prior experience sit down and try to follow along with these tutorials. They'd quickly see the problem. I truly hope they continue to improve and update this course, because this is something I've wanted to learn for a very long time. It started out quite promising, but now I'm back to feeling like I know absolutely nothing after dozens of hours of doing this course and rewatching the videos and asking questions on the forum trying to make sense of any of it."
"great course which is getting me where i want to be. The course helps you understand all aspects of unreal engine 4 and and using c++ with it, I'd recommend it to anyone willing to dedicate there time into making games of any genre."
"A great resource even if you are experienced with BP development, I learned a lot of things, and makes UE4 C++ understandable."
"Thank you very much for all instructor of this course because they teach me about unreal's basic things. I recomment this course for very beginners about C++ coding and game design. However, I dont recomment this course for people who familier with c++. The course don't seperate c++, coding style and unreal parts each other. Therefore, course became very boring after 260. section. As a result, i stop the following course then move the same people's multiplayer gaming course. I hope it will be more benefitial. Perhaps, I can come back and continue the course but espacially bug fixing and giving some assignments parts take so much time. I think if these parts removed from course, people who knows some coding can move on the end of course. Or you can create a new course for people who knows c++."
"Really informative but as a C++ beginner I feel like some lectures make unexpected leaps and I'm presented with problems there's no way for me to know how to resolve yet. I also feel like it'd be good to get more consistent explanations of WHY we're using certain commands in certain ways, rather than just what we need to write to make the thing work."
"till now its going pretty good ,learned some important things to implement in own project , will review at the end of the course."
"Good course, older sections which are yet to be updated, let the course down a bit in comparison to the newer ones. When latter sections are updated I think this course will be five star."
"The target demographic of beginner learner is a bit off. The course should have a big warning video at the start saying: "" Knowing basic C++ is recommended before starting this course, we recommend this other course in udemy/youtube from ..."".

Then start comparing what is different in unreal vs C++. Then the course will be better for both beginner and people who just want to learn unreal.

Edit: The pure C++ section doesnt translate well on to other section and feel a bit rush. New programer will look at VS code and think: ""what is this .h, what is a class, why is the syntax works like that??"". Some prior C++ knowledge is still recommended before starting.

Edit2: The problem i was trying to say its the way you guys teach. You can either teach every dry concept ever like polymorphism, class hierarchy,... Or you can brush some concept off, and get straight in to showing problem and solution. But because you chose the 2nd one, it create a sense of uncertainty for student. Thats why most of the bad review are from people who just feel like they are copy pasting, and not learning/or understanding anything. There isnt any guarantee that this solution will help them with their own ideal and game. If you dont want to spent hours explaining unreal source code, but want to solve the feeling of being ""lost"" that student have, then pls give your student some kind of certainty like showing example of how your solution is implemented in other game and ideal,... It will help student feel like they are learning something, and not ""ok? How does this lecture about fps game gonna help me with my golf game ideal?""."
It's an amazing course. I love it. I wish it was a bit less focus on UE4's features and more focus on CPP. For example no need to go and find textures and assign them and look into materials and so on.. These have their own courses. The time spent on such episodes could be easily used to do more cpp code.
"It is really hard to develop some challenges, but that is because of C++. Just push through and you will learn a lot"
"Even though I'm halfway through the course I'm very satisfied with the content. Tips on C++ environment makes development a lot easier by avoiding a fight against the IDE, for instance."
"I believe that this course is very good for those who already know c++. For those who are new to programming, this course might be too complicated."
The course is 100 percent Suggested For those who wanna make professional games THANKS LOT Dreams had come true
"Wish I could get a refund for this mess of a course. I already know C++, and yet I struggled to keep up with the ""Teachers"". Constantly changing things on the fly, and just doing things without exactly even knowing why we're doing them.

The structure of the course is extremely extremely poor. Instead of saying ""Hey, in this section we'll learn how to create this feature in our game"", the teachers just start writing code and explaining things, without you even knowing what the purpose of those things are. Would not recommend the course at all, especially for beginners.

Finally, not to mention that you don't actually learn skills needed for actual games, and the engine used is 4.22, while the current latest unreal engine is almost 4.26."
This course has definitely taught me a bunch about game development. It is an amazing bang-for-your-buck course and I would recommend it to others. The only reason it is a 4.5 star is that some of the concepts don't seem to have a great explanation but those moments are very rare.
Excellent explanation. The content is updated constantly and is very thorough and challenging.
Great intro to Unreal and C++ so far as of Lecture 120 :) A solid pace for beginners diving into making games and coding :)
"Overall a good course that covers a wide array of topics. There are some frustrating aspects, but only one worth mentioning.

There are a lot of edits in the lessons where the instructor comments and records over the existing lesson to fix mistakes or to add info they left out instead of re-recording the lesson completely. This is just lazy, breaks your focus and adds confusion.

Overall, I do recommend this course as a starting point in game development."
"I'm still going through the videos, and its based on an older version 4.22 (Still a very good version to work with). But this is a very solid course. The lecture that 100% sold me on the course was 65. Const Member Functions.

I have some experience with C++ and one thing I can say for sure is when you have a Coder teaching you the importance of setting things up like this you know you have someone who is going in with a very good coding mentality."
I'm almost done with the ToonTank section. In this section they changed the teaching method and I think I'm not learning much anymore...let's see what happens with the last section.
"Most of the coding lectures starting with the ""real"" section(Building Escape) was too fast compared to the CowBull Game Section. I almost got the gist of some of it due to some understanding of classes and OOPS from c++ like needing to ""get"" initial value of the object and ""set"" it to new value and stuff like that, but the other parts are just too confusing like what needs to be included into which file(headers or cpp?) and etc."
"This course is a literal case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Some sections, like Escape, are great. The instructor takes time to explain in detail what he is doing as well as why you want to do it. I know C++ extremely well and found myself wishing it moved at a bit faster pace at times; however, I'm willing to forgive this since the course has 'learn C++' in the title. This instructor does a great job of covering a lot of material.

Then you get to the Toon Tanks section. There is no easy way to say it...this section is downright awful and I find it amazing that it is part of the same course. The instructor makes hardly any attempt to explain why you are doing anything. I would classify it more as a 'do what I say', except there are numerous times he doesn't actually bother to say what it is he is doing and you have to rewind the video 5 times and try to decipher it based on whatever is happening on screen. This makes it extremely difficult to follow along in real-time. To make matters worse, he continuously uses the wrong terms for various items which is going to make it that much harder for some people to follow along.

5 stars for some parts and 1 star for others.. 3 stars overall."
Really Amazing course. Everything is super clear and they offer great help whenever you are stuck. There is so much material and they explain everything really well and they focus on the important topics. I have learned so much and I would definitely recommend this course.
"Very excited and happy of how well it is organized. hopefully I feel it will cover more topics than other courses I have tried.

Edit 1: Halfway there, still above expectations and the demonstration of theories and new concepts is excellent, also showing the importance of cleaning and refactoring code."
"It is good for what I need, although it has gotten seemingly complex because of Level blueprints etc. I was hoping to be able to learn to use unreal without blueprints, but that seems impossible.

I dont feel like I am learning to use Blueprints, rather being shown how to keep up with the tutorial. A intro lecture on the basics of blueprint (actions, functions, variables, parameters etc) may have been useful!"
I enjoy having the ability to watch and replicate the code then take a break and think about the why's and how's. Being able to take small steps and let it soak in is best for my personal learning experience.
This was a very nice introduction to Unreal Engine with C++! I really enjoyed it!
"The general C++ part and the building escape game sections were brilliant! Those parts motivated me to keep going on daily! Then the toon tanks section started and I quit the course, because the use of blueprints totally confused me and therer were so manyerros in the first few videos I couldn't stand it. Maybe I will continue again later with the simple shooter part. I don't know that yet."
"Started out far too easy, otherwise content was great, explained well and discord makes this course a great pick for anyone who have essentially no experience with unreal."
