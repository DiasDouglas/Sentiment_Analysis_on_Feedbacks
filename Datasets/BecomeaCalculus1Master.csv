"Great Calculus course! I really like the layout of the course with the lectures, quizzes and bonus questions for each section. Moving on to Krista's Calculus 2 course!"
"Amazing teacher, amazing format, amazing examples. Couldn't he happier with course. If I had any negative feedback it would trivial and not worth mentioning.

I haven taken some other courses by Kristi and they never fail to exceed expectations. She is a truly gifted teacher.

And this from a 63 old Grandfather who doesn't impress easily and NEVER provides feedback at the end of the course!"
Krista is a terrific teacher and her classes couldn't be more clear and explanatory. Her teaching is extremely engaging and easy to follow and her courses are saving my math! This is the best calculus course I could have ever purchased.
Much better than at school but there could be some more conceptual videos explaining what that particular section mean using pictures and graphs. Awesome with conjuction with Khan Academy.
"Having not taken any calculus for ~20 years, this was a great refresher. Krista King is an excellent teacher and I would recommend this course to anybody wanting to learn or refresh their calculus skills."
"Great course... a big thanks to the instructor. Simple words, clear explanations,diagrams and problems with solutions, everything that i needed. Thought i couldn't understand math but this course just changed my mind!"
"This course is an outstanding review of the concepts and methods taught in basic calculus (through differentiation). The explanations are very clear and easy to understand, reinforced by many worked examples. And the videos do a great job walking step by step through the concepts taught. I thought the course was well worth the time and money."
"Very nicely done. Concise, clear explanations with interesting and relevant examples. Provides excellent overall understanding of concepts and good practice problems. Highly recommend."
"Had to retake calculus as prerequisite for a Master's degree. I last tool calc ten years ago, and the course my program make me take had terrible, dated lectures, and incomprehensible practice problems. Kirsta King helped me remember everything in way that stuck better than any math class I've ever had. Exceptional experience!"
"This was an excellent course. The instructor was very well prepared and the work put in to create the course is obvious given the notes, explanations, quizzes, and additional problems.

I do believe the course should be named ""Differential Calculus"", as integration is left to another course. In the Calculus I courses I have taken both differential and integral calculus were taught.

Truly an excellent course."
"This is an amazing course; Krista is able to explain, and walk through, all of these concepts in easy to understand ways. She's also very responsive when you have any questions on one of the videos.

I've already purchased Calculus 2 and 3, and will be continuing on with those.

Thanks, Krista!"
"Krista's courses are the gold standard to which other Udemy courses should be measured. She starts with the basics and systematically work towards the more difficult subject matter without leaving the student behind.

It is evident that Krista uses professional recording equipment, her videos and sound is always clear and understandable. In my opinion all Udemy educators should enroll in one of Krista's classes to see what quality education looks like."
I have gone through all the problems of this course. All the material available to know calculus 1. Best Experience I've ever got in any of courses.
"This was a great way to relearn Calculus as I head back to college after a decade off. The real test will be how well I do in Cal III this coming semester, but I feel I have a better handle on Cal I now than I did when I completed it the first time through."
clear and informative. the lessons pace is slightly slow. (Written as of section 3 of the lessons)
Explanations could have been much easier. I had to go to youtube at times and refer to other videos and then come back to this one for better clarity.
"Krista does a really good job at breaking down the concepts. I have tried to learn calculus many times before, but it has never stuck until now. Thanks!"
"Thank you! Difficult things described clear and simple, material is perfectly structured"
"I did not go through the full course, but got exactly what I needed, in future I might finish the course."
Really good course! I took it in order to revise the concepts from highschool and it is amazing! Very clear and fast explanation; I went over it in 4 days :))
"Awesome teacher!!! She is able to explain complex topics in an effective way, making it simpler to understand.

I definitely recommend her courses. I have bought all the Calculus series."
Very clear. I like the fact that the walkthroughs take it step by step and that Krista repeats so much of her reasoning throughout her problem solving. Thoroughly enjoying the course so far.
Preparing to take Calc II 15 years after taking Calc I. I think this course has done an incredible job of giving me a refresher in Calc I. Thanks Krista.
It was very helpful for me. I really learned a lot from this course.
"Krista, you are a masterpiece! You are Awesome!"
"Thank you, Krista! It's been over a decade since I've seriously done any math, and your course was perfect for taking me from 0 (zero) up to speed. Highly recommend this course, and I plan on enrolling in more of Krista's courses in the calculus stream and linear algebra."
"Great explanations, problems and solutions. Video explanations, especially practical application videos, were fantastic."
Explanations are very clear. Notes and problems with solutions are attached with each topics.
I like clear explanation of the concept in this course. There are sufficient study material and quizzes also. I am gonna take another lesson from her. Thank you.
"It is great learning. Enjoyed each and every lesson.

Thanks a lot...."
"The style of teaching, handwriting, voice, contents...everything is great!"
Excellent course. Great explanations and step by step solutions in order to grasp everything important in Calculus I. I'm looking forward to take the Calculus II and Calculus III courses.
"Very well made course, I'm am very pleased!"
This course is great! I am taking this course while taking Calculus in college and I am doing great in the class!
I been using this to review calculus after taking a few years off from it before retrying calculus 2. The speed I can go through this and amount of knowledge I get from this is amazing. I suggest everyone who wants to take calculus to try these online lessons from her first. I wouldn't have had trouble if I did.
I was able to take Calculus with confidence thanks to this course!
"Mathematics's all about the way you can interpret the world. I take calculus at university about 15 years ago. So I've known the basics of this subject. But still, I decided not to skip the first sections. This course is amazing. Krista doesn't skip anything, doesn't assume you have previous knowledge, and explains everything in depth. After taking this extensive course you can be sure that you will have the necessary confidence to master this subject. And now I know that I will buy more Krista courses, next it will be probability and statistics."
it has been a wonderful and an enriching experience till now
Its great learning calculus from this course. It has helped me understand the nuances of calculus which I was lacking earlier.
"Super ! I love it , she is very clear and make me believe in Math . And i start from nothing"
Awesome course. I watch this while taking Calculus 1 online.
Excellent job presenting and covering the material. It was a very pleasant experience.
This course is very useful for me to gain insight about the notions of limits and derivatives.
"Great examples, good exercises and it helped me to remember and practice limits and derivatives."
"This is a review for me so far, but it is very thoughtful and well laid out."
"Love the course! I've purchased most of Krista's courses and am learning so much!

I'd like to see more challenging practice problems on the quizzes."
The instructor is extremely active in the Q & A. I felt I gained a good understanding of calculus. I wish this course would give you an introduction into integrals although.
It is perfect to refresh material that I have not seen in years
"Sometimes the math is just stated rather than explained. If we are just meant to memorise formulas rather than understand them, this affects the foundations of understanding."
I am impressed you did a good job on explaining the fundemtals in course that was 16 weeks so quick
Best one .. i got refreshed from the course
"In a whole, that's a nice course. The only negative point (IMHO) is that she spends a lot of time doing basic arithmetic!"
It's a great course! Explanations and examples are generally very clear.
Very clear explanations and examples. Really enjoying the material so far. Krista is an amazing teacher! The quizzes and extra problems are really solid and allow you to think about different scenarios that further solidifies the material. Great course and I cannot wait to take more courses from Krista.
Great course! I would recommended this to a friend. It has covered all topics so far
Learned the topics required for my calc class here
Great explanations for most functions in Calculus. The quizzes and practice problems also serve as good reinforcement. Some of the step by step answers to the quizzes could be a little more clear.
She makes math understandable! Broken down into the simplest explanation...not a bowtie and pocket protector kind of course! I LOVE IT!!!
The best course to begin calculus with.
"The teaching is fantastic! Very clear and understandable. The material is very well laid-out, and the extra bonus problems are a definite plus. Kristi King has done an outstanding job laying all this material out, and she is a wonderfully clear teacher - a rarity in the field of mathematics."
"Really helpful, must admit!

Thank you Krista for sharing your geniousness with us ;)"
"No matter at which level you are, you'll walk away from this course after learning something new.. Great course!!"
I've never found a course with such great attention to detail. I make a lot of mistakes as i go along but thanks to the constant quizzing i am able to see my mistakes and better myself.
Nice and well packaged course. i recommend this for anyone that really wants to Master Calculus1!
"Explanations are well paced and clearly spoken. I like the hand written expressions that are in step with the dialog because they appear on the screen at about the same speed as I can comprehend them and are looking similar to the work I eventually produce on paper when I do the examples. This seems to settle into my memory better than examples portrayed with beautiful ""power point"" type slides instantly on the screen all at once as they are talked about. Kind of a good connection between auditory and visual perception that works well for me. Thanks"
Great course
"I'm actually overwhelmed by how helpful this course is. I'm in an online calculus course with a teacher who was told the class was going to be online (covid-19) a week before class started. He's not using any online resources and it's basically just him expecting us to learn everything from the textbook and not explaining anything from the beginning. I was convinced that I would actually fail this class, but now I feel a lot more comfortable with the subject matter.

I really appreciate how the courses go back to pre-calc so I can refresh things I'm not remembering 100%- my professor just assumes we have it all completely memorized and refuses to break problems down into small steps. I do wish these lectures didn't cost as much as I'm paying for my accredited class, but still an extra $150 to pass and be prepared for calc 2 is pretty worth it."
"TLDR: Not worth the money.

If you are coming here from KhanAcademy/Youtube and expecting better content since you are actually paying for it, then you will be disappointed - I am not nitpicking on some tinny mistakes here but overal concept of those lectures: there is no motivation or context for the methods explained, no real life problems are solved, all the definitions are explained in the typical conformist fashion without any (even tiny) step further to uncover what is the fancy-academia-ego-sugar and what is the essence of the proof. Not my cup of tea!

If you use it as a basic outline of your Calculus progress & addition exercise material it is ok, but expect to go elsewhere as well (other platforms/books) if you want to really dig deeper and create proper connections."
This is a really good course!
This is a really great course for learning Limits and Derivatives. The course is very well structured. You understand the essence of these topics and appreciate it. What I really like about Krista King is that she provides Notes which I find really useful. Thanks for this course.
Thanks a lot! After I did this course I subscribed to all of your other courses. I will do them all (some of them just for fun) and looking forward to any of your future courses!
"Great course, good content, clear explanation, and most importantly, the Q&A forum is great (quick and excellent response). Thank you Krista!"
"I previously left a review that was, while by no means scathing, left while in a frustrated state of mind.

Have no doubt that this is an outstanding course and helped me tremendously . You will require knowledge of math concepts leading up to calculus coming into this series, however that's true of any class in any discipline; no course can be 100% comprehensive.

If you've worked your way up to calculus, you will find this an invaluable instruction, guide, tool, and reference for continuing your math journey."
Great course. Simple and easy to understand. Hopefully it translates well with US standards and college calculus.
The basics are not covered in depth.It is assumed that the students knows all the fundamentals.
"Great course, Krista King explains concepts in an easy to understand format."
This course is made easy to understand with simple examples and Every concept is well explained.
Well-structured material. Clear and concise explanations. Rich practical part. High-quality work in overall. Recommend to anyone who plans to start calculus.
THis is good stuff
Love the course! Krista is very thorough with her explanations and ensures you know the basics before moving on. I'm learning much more from this course than when I first took Calculus 1 in school.
"Yes - I have attempted calculus at university with an incompetent teacher and didn't complete it. I am enjoying the topic this time, and really appreciate the clear and concise explanations. Excellent course!"
The explanations are very clear and concise.
I haven't touched calculus seriously in 35 years. This is a thorough and systematic review. Very pleased.
Well structured with enough practice questions. Really liked it.
"Thank you very much! This is the best Calculus 1 Course that I've studied. I've learn too much more than I could have imagined, I highly recommend this course. Thanks a lot Krista King, you're the best"
So far yes. I am using this course as a refresher as I take Calculus 2 this fall.
"It has been a good match for me. The course, until now, has been explain in and easy and simple way. Congrats!"
It's a great refresher and a great way to condense a textbook for those who are looking for the applications.
Krista is an excellent teacher and know her way around calculus and other related topics! her teaching style has helped me understand more in three days than i could in 3 weeks! glad i found this course!
"I've been through Calc II before, but it's been a while. The reason I stopped was because of the Calc and the differentiation / trig identities - it just got too much at that time. I sure wish I would've found Krista before - even now, I'm hung up as I retake it, and this is where I am turning because no book is like her!!! Thank you Krista you are making the world a better place!!"
Wonderful Course! Easy to follow and understand.
"Most of the times, the videos can be played at 1,5 speed, but sometimes you just need that extra time.

Good coverage, Good handouts for review and practice material and very nice presenting skills and a very pleasant voice.

Note, this is not just a course you can finish in a few days... It's a real workout..."
Very good course. Clear explanations and many practice problems(in pdf)
"Very glad to continue my math study after high school, which has always been my dream ever since. and I'm lucky to have a top math instructor from the States."
Really good explanation thus far. I didn’t realise how much even my basic maths skills need polished but Calc was something I really struggled with and although in the early stages it seems to be sinking in. Thank you
The topics are broken up into small easily digestible pieces with lucid explanation. Makes learning math easy
"I've taken some of her previous Math courses and this one is just as good as those, which is to say it is pretty good."
"I am taking Calculus II next semester, but haven't taken a calculus course for a few years and wanted to review the basics prior to entering Calc II. Udemy is providing me with the structure I desired for going about my review."
it is very helpful and amazing. i learned a lot
The course was a good match for me
