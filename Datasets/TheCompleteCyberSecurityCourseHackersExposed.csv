"The course was well explained and simplified for beginners like me providing indepth information with visual examples and step by step teaching. The tons of resources were very helpful. It is a good course for anyone who wants to step into the cyber security field & can also help anyone who is interested in knowing how to stay safe on the internet and from Cyber attacks.

I have learned a lot from this one course and looking forward to the next 3 parts. Good job Nathan....keep up the good work."
"Yes, i got some ideas about cyber security and so many IT terms which is awesome"
It has given me a wonderful understanding of the fundamental before going into the more advanced sections of security.
Un peu trop technique et un peu trop rapide à mon goût. La haute technicité des algorithmes de sécurité mériterait que l'on s'attarde un peu plus sur chaque concept important.
Most valuable class so far. Nathan is an excellent instructor with a tremendous wealth of knowledge. I highly recommend his courses.
This course is just I wanted to get me started into Cybersecurity training. I have a background in law with a interested data privacy & policy knowing nothing about the tech side to feeling more confident in becoming a skilled professional in the sector.
Very educative .I just realized that I am tyro a in Cyber security
Very in-depth course. Highly recommend sticking to the very end and you must be proactive in your learning in order to maximise your potential.
"Excellent Course.....Once said, ""Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe"". This applies purely to this course, an excellent road map of cyber security from fundamental to advance. @Nathan not only discussed offensive security practices, but also about defensive security, which is rarely found in one place. This course is an excellent blend of White Hat to Blue Hat Security. I enjoyed all the sections.

Thanks Sir and a sincere respect to your efforts on making such nice volumes/courses.

Course covered a wealth of topics and strategies; very worthwhile. Took off a 1/2 star since a fair amount of the examples are somewhat dated - yet the concepts are still valid and applicable.
"There is so much great material that's presented in this course. I will warn anyone looking to take this that having a good background knowledge of OS's, networking, and basic security will be helpful. If you don't have it, you'll be doing a good bit of research and/or catch up study to feel comfortable with many of the terms/topics. Aside from that, this course is an excellent step to move beyond basic theory and into practical application. My thanks for taking the time to create this course. Nicely done :)"
"So much information and so many resources! I am happy I can return to the course to refer back to them.

Thanks for all the great information. I hope to do the other volumns."
"Truly great, very vast and easy to understand. The first level is recommended to know hot to set ready your systems to be online with security, privacy, and anonymity."
"I like this course a lot. One thing though, the teacher could be more aware of his diction. He is really difficult to follow when he talks under his breath."
"This course will take you to the trip of complete security industry where you will get to know about industry basics, current issues with systems, govt and websites i.e google, facebook etc. involvement in your digital personal life, difference type of OS and their use from security perspective.

Volume 1 is not about hacker its about us how we are securing our self from the threats."
I really liked it but I would like it to have some sort of testing as to see if I've learnt anything at all
This course is good as it covers the fundamentals we are dealing each day over the internet. The instructor was helpful in getting my doubts cleared and hopefully a good start for me to know about cyber security.
"As a whole, I'd recommend Volume 1 as a bare minimum for pretty much ANY IT field, not just Cyber Security. Volume 1 is mostly just the fundamental theory behind security. It provides detailed knowledge of many topics including Encryption, Social Engineering basics, Threat and Risk Assessment, and more. The hands-on/practical application takes a research-it-yourself approach. Though what is there, Nathan clearly states what should and should-not be used and clearly defines when they should be used. As he mentioned at the start of the course, you need to understand the fundamental theory of what is out there first, and I agree with this. However, if you have any background in networking/virtualization/security, a good portion of Volume 1 you will likely already know in-depth or understand the basics and maybe only gain a slightly deeper understanding of the topics. The most useful part of Volume 1 are the abundant resource links; if it was mentioned even briefly in the course, he provided a source, and he keeps the resources updated (at least up to Aug 2020).

If I had any complaints or suggestions for Volume 1, it would maybe be to add some quizzes or interaction scattered throughout to help retention. Especially for those of us who were already doing some/most of the stuff brought up here, most of Volume 1 isn't interactive and what is only takes a few minutes to do. I found my mind frequently wandering and having to rewind the videos when I noticed I wasn't paying attention anymore. Volume 1 has buckets full of good intel and I think maybe a quiz with a few related questions every 30 minutes or so would significantly improve memory retention, as otherwise there can be several hour gaps where it is really just lecturing and no reinforcement."
"Excellent fundamental course that covers the key aspects of security. Although it lacks methods to secure android and phone security in general, everything else is great."
"In-depth information and an excelent introduction to privacy and anonymity. Although the students have to do their own research, but this course is absolutely a MUST for everyone. Technically inclined or not. Period.

I will continue with the other 3 volumes! StationX has been my ""go-to"" for information when I started this journey. Can't wait to get the VIP membership!"
"This course is interesting because it opens the ""mind"" about Cyber Security. I believe the next course will be more hand-on and this is important too."
course is very good i learn very much new about security and privacy but it can be little bit overview not a deep learn about security and different os
"Extremely recommendable for everyone, or at least for every IT responsible person in an organisation. Full of great advices. Looking forward for next chapters."
"Well, this course has helped me know a lot of loop holes and vulnerabilities that I need to work on to ensure our organisation network is protected."
Excellent course. It covers the basics pretty well. It is a good starting point to then search for more information.
"Hoped that he had included some practicals too. Example - Kali Linux commands for hacking. But, the theoretical knowledge is really beneficial."
"As someone wanting to branch into technology area of study, this course was an eye opener and good way to start. Let me also add that the instructor is brilliant and a master at his craft. He simply knows the stuff he is talking about.

The info in the course was definitely interesting and a lot for my brains, that is how it felt at times. I expected that. The interest will spur me on to delve deeper into this field and build on this foundation. I learned a lot and highly recommend it"
"An amazing course!. To be honest, the technical level that Nathan puts to this course, is great and easy to understand. It also completes the content with great resources (as an extra help) to keep reading and learning even more about this topic. I will surely recommend this to anyone who's interested in start learning about CyberSec. Cheers!.."
Many usefull insights and options to try out myself. If I need this in a work environment I can just go back to this course to lookup the details.
So far so good. but i believe practicals from the beginning will help keep one on track. Some little tips before the real tutorial section in the latter part of the course
"This course has taught me alot about how cyber attacks work and what can be done to prevent them and keep myself secure. I'm a newbie to the world of Cyber Security but am an avid tech geek. Thank you for great intro. Looking forward to Volumes 2, 3 and 4."
"Upon the completion of Volume 1, I feel that I have got a better understanding of the security need and why is it important. It helped me understand different security threats within operating systems and allowed me to test it as well using virtual machines. Overall, I think this course is definitely worth watching if you are planning on starting with cyber security."
Really loved all the content. Just put it on 1.5x speed and enjoy. All the info is really useful and hope onto volume2. =D
"It is a good introductory to Cyber Security. As an IT security specialist, there are things that I learned on this video that I haven't known before."
As a person who didn`t know anything about cyber security . I learned too many new informations and understood many mistakes i made earlier while using Internet=)
"Amazing course, very instructive will definitely recommend to everyone to learn more about security. I plan to continue the course through the rest of the parts."
"It is good and helpful for people to make sure what we have to do for prevent from malware and other cyber theatres and to be adapted with awerness of the security, privacy and to stay anonymous."
"I really got lot of knowledge about the the tools and the Operating Systems ..but there is about 70-80% of theory and 15-20% practical..!..And specially you need ""PATIENCE"" in this course"
"Nathan, the instructor of this course, is a very knowledgeable person. There is so much in this course, it is loaded with many aspects of cyber security. But it is not a step by step instructions course."
"Some information I already knew, some are a bit obsolete, but overall quite insightful."
"It was a good start to understand about security and how to prepare you and be aware of what is out there and how you can protect yourself. you learn a few things to help you out to secure your system. This is just the beginning I guess, as I do think there is more things to learn in the following courses next. But it was a great introduction to the world of cybersecurity. Thank you Nathan."
"Overall, this is an excellent course. There's tons of useful information in here. I rate it 4 stars because there is a lot of technical jargon that is used, but not explained.

This makes it challenging at times to grasp the information. A simplified breakdown for more complex/technical terms would be appreciated for a newcomer like myself.

Overall, fantastic course, I definitely recommend it."
"Comprehensive material and presented in a professional way.

some of the link are not valid. (web pages)."
There is so much valuable information. I usually replay entire courses to get the most from it.
"Brilliant content and narration. What a way to make a first impression. In-depth knowledge exhibited by the instructor, the material is very relevant and full of insight. Plenty of resources made available for extra study. Very impressed by the quality of this course. The effort is much appreciated."
"The instructor speaks very well and concise, this course is in depth and covers a platitude of security risks and fixes. Along with educational websites, and information to continue to learn from, beyond the completion of this course."
I feel exited to know the security aspects while performing the day today computer works at office and home. Need to learn more.
"It's a really interesting course, especially good for begginers with 0 knowledge about cyber security"
"First chapter is rather focused on basics and psychology behind hacking and cybersecurity. The closer to the second chapter the more course seems to involve. I am satisfied and recommend the course, but there are few disadventages.

Cybersecurity is broad subject so there are many many references in the course, so be aware, that 50% of the course are the links for articles which you can study, and tools that you can test. Part of them (~40% of extra tools) are no longer free or available (but common are still valid, so it doesn't make course outdated) or the web frontend changed . If you want to pull out as much as possible from the course, test tools, play around with settings, VMs and stay focused"
Very good course to understand cybersecurity. I managed to learn alot of new techniques and security measures. I recommend this course to anyone who is interested in having knowledge about cybersecurity.
"I felt a little bit monotonous and the level like a common-sense, basics information. There weren't any links for the interesting sites to try them. I hope the next step will be better."
"Um ótimo curso para abrir a mente das pessoas que pensam em tornar-se profissionais da segurança da informação. Finalizei o 1º volume, porém, creio que os 4 volumes irão agregar uma base ainda maior. Até o momento eu recomendo!

A great course to open the minds of people thinking about becoming information security professionals. I finished the 1st volume, however, I believe that the 4 volumes will add an even bigger base. So far I recommend it!"
A little more download guidance for Mac users would be nice. I still managed to download the Virtual Box and other OS systems into VBox with the help of some YouTube videos and am now back on track.
very good but some of the material is dated and the web links no longer exist.
"I really enjoyed the online course. It was well planned and easy for me.

Yes this course is very helpful."
"this is an amazing course, Some links in the resource section are expired or not loading."
"This course was a lot more technical than what I expected and often used terms that I was not familiar with. Overall, I am very happy to have taken his course as it exposed me to concepts that I had not thought about or was aware of. I will need to go through the course again in order to get a better understanding of the concepts involved.

The course is delivered in small chunks that are easy to digest. I especially like that you tell us what to expect at the beginning of each section.

I recommend it to anyone interested in preserving their privacy and security.

Thank you very much for keeping this subject simple."
"Amazingly covered the basics of cyber-security with relevant examples, demonstrations and news articles. Thank you for this course!"
The introduction is very informative. It brings the various issues associated with cyber security clearly to my attention and peaks my interest even more.
"Very good intro, lots of good links to tools, sites, extra material. Good speaker."
"I got an Masters of information system in security in 2015 that taught me about virtualization and kali and vulnerability patching. This is a great refresher. But its 2020 now and some of the settings discussed are changed, but that's just a sign of how fast everything's changing nowadays. Thanks for keeping it accurate and fresh, it is difficult to keep up with the times, but not with your excellent delivery."
I enjoyed the course and it was very educational for the Cyber Security Field.
"It was a really nice course, it opened my eyes to a lot of the stuff thats going on. I may not have completely understood everything as of now, but it's a good thing I can repeat the course anytime. Thank you for your making it."
The level of technical details is fantastic and the clear and straightforward method of explaining the concepts is a big plus. Recommended for anyone who cares about security.
"This course is outstandingly good for everyone at any age and at any time.

I am an 8 years (going to be 9 in October) and I really have passion about cyber threats and security.

If you have the passion to do it you will really enjoy this course.

My dad got me this course because he saw I had the passion."
Good knowledge platform
Excellent instructor. Very easy to follow along. He does a great job of presenting the cyber security landscape in a very understandable way.
"Excelent course for beginners. It provides the tools that every expert needs to know to become an expert. It is an introductory course but it explains so many important things that you need to know! It provides practical lessons as well. In fact, Nathan encourages you to keep investigating and learning by yourself, to explore further the topics learned in the lessons with his help (he always answers the questions).

Nathan is excellent in all his explanations: clear pronunciation, adequate pace (not too fast, nor too slow) and very detailed explanations.

The audio quality is excellent. The resources available for further reading are up to date and, if not, Nathan will provide another link or solution."
"The course was great, easy to follow. I will be starting your other programs in this series as I finish each course. I am thankful for your course and the enlightenment it has provided. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Robert Cull-Psy.D."
"The instructor is very knowledgeable and knows what he is talking about. He breaks down the topic so it is easy to understand while not wasting time on smaller details. The course well covers theory, definitions, and basics, which fits the title ""Hackers exposed"" extremely well. The instructor covers many OS in his examples. I will be starting the second course in the series and highly recommend anyone interested in information security to take this course.

If this type of thing matters to anyone, the instructor's voice is calm and pleasing to the ear."
"I have taken several other cyber security, nettworking, and IT cources, but this course is above my expectations. The other courses were very little hands on, unlike this course which provides an abundance of resources and hands on practice."
"Excellent course, at a good pace for the debutants and lots of links to save for future references. now on volume 2."
"Very intersting and complete. just one advice, why not put all the links in a downloadable document ?"
"It has been very helpful following and practicing the lessons.

Recommendation

Add a quiz at the end of each section so learners can refresh their knowledge"
"I believe that this course provides strong basics on introduction to cybersecurity, privacy anonymity, tools, operating systems and a lot more combined in a single package."
"It fells like the instructor is just reading a boring story book. The course is not practical or technical at all, it's not interactive and very difficult to maintain the interest and continue watching videos, the instructor does not care about the understanding level of the students, he just start talking of any topic of any level without setting a proper base to insure that the viewers understand. horrible"
"links are expired and different version of os is creating problem in following the steps. in short outdated course till now as we are talking about win 10. i have to see whether this implies to linux based os also or they are not changed in the update.

for me its not point to point guide as the video contains old os config. but i can say its good to know all these but again what if i am not able to use or find that perticular option in my os."
"I had a good experience listening to all the lectures carefully, but only 121 of my lectures are showing this and how to get the certificate of course"
"Very informative, would be better if hands on lab in each lecture."
"In short: It's a fantastic course that I would highly recommend for anyone who wishes to jump in/enrich their knowledge in regards to cyber security.

The instructor (Nathan House) provides good and clear explanations on various topics, good resources to do some further digging yourself outside the course and good tips on how to start your own career in the world of IT security.

Although I wasn't new to IT security since I studied it in college there were some new areas/tips on how to stay safe/anonymous online, and some areas were pretty much a revision of what I've already learned. No matter how green you are in terms of IT security I would say this course is for you.

The only minor problem was that the English subtitles are auto-generated which in rare occasions can lead to some confusion, and sometimes to hilarious results. However that's just nitpicking as the content of the course is quite clear regardless of subtitles."
"This course was very interesting, although I was expecting something more practical."
Great introduction to web security. Lots of material. Super well explained.
The way this course explains you things is excellent. He takes time to explain it properly takes you to use them practically and moreover provides good resources.
"Some of the links/materials are a bit outdated (although Nathan does warn us about that), the basic concepts are explained quite lucidly."
The course was very informative. It was what I expected and then some.
"Good to introduce people on security. However, it might be boring for those who already have some background with IT and security. It could also provide more practical examples of the theory that is showed."
cool resource however i didn't hear him say what to do with the hackers info but yes change my pw and stuff I also changed my settings to hopefully be a little more secure I would need extra training to really understand what i am doing if i get the vmware but i like the resource.
"The course has a lot of details, a lot of theory, not much practice, however it gives you a good intro into cyber security"
"I rated this course four times this being the last rating, my review upon completion. my first rating of 4 stars was hopeful for valuable content that would give me security online and within my pc structure. I lowered the next rating to a 3 1/2 because that security content was not being delivered in a prompt manner. the instructor did give decent information but not enough to satisfy my internet and security paranoia. this last 5-star rating sums up everything, after reaching the no refund halfway through the course mark he delivered in my opinion. If you want total security keep off the internet and/or limit its use considerably. if you need to be on the internet or want extra security or anonymity than he does give enough tools to keep safe and concealed. great learning voice, speed of instruction, and content provided were worth the price I paid. I have purchased the next course and will complete the series. A grateful thank you for providing the most important aspect of the web and data - security."
"Still a lot to learn, but quite insightful. I will be enrolling for more courses."
very good course great overview to get started on cyber security in depth
"Literally the first video and I just learned one of the most effective techniques.

Amazing course!"
"All the videos are good,

I have good experience with this course"
The course has been very informative and makes each topic very clear to understand.
"very in depth and comprehensive, the one feedback for Nathan is to document all links in one place under relevant headings."
"Very good content, but a bit outdated in my opinion. Should update some sections so the example shown to the student reflect what they're going to see when they try it. Would love to have a demo on how to setup a VPN in Qubes OS."
It was an amazing course. Each and every point has been explained in details. The most lovable part is first section or starting of the course which has attracted me be completed this course.
I already knew about 1/2 the theory covered in this course. The practical sections of this course were very educational! I expect to have weeks of fun setting up my VMs for the follow-on courses!
Am gaining knowledge and getting lots information to help my information technology consulting practice
"Yes this is good. It is quite basic, but some are pretty new to me like QubesOS."
