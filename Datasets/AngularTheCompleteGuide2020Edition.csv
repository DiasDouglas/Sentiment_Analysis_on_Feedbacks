"This guy is just the best <3 Max will help you understand topics as deep as necessary.

He also has fun verbal comments :D"
"Basically, this course is great. I split my opinion into 4-star achievement and one star missing.

4-star achievement:

Well organized, most of its content is updated. This course is built in a way that helps the students to practice and internalize the material properly.

However:

One star missing:

There is no proper introduction for RXJS operators such as map, tap, switchMap, and so on.

The Angular-Universal section was very bad explained and not updated.

The last two chapters needed to be presented earlier in this course"
Max you are rockstar ! Many are shifting now a days to react but there is a solid reason angular exist's and you have done a great job.
"I really love this course. As a web developer, I learned angular for a while, and this is the most clear and nice course I've ever learned.

Also I have to say Maximilian is really awesome, those bonus courses really useful, hope to learn more from him!

Really helpful, thanks to Maximilian provides me this Angular complete guide!!!"
"Some parts of the course are still using old versions packages, Feels like, he is just changing the Name of the course only. But overall It is a Great course."
"Request you dont mix regular concept teaching and course project.

Follow only once. Course project can be added as bonus.

As the course is progressing concepts teaching also shifyted to course project. one who dont follow course project they cant understand the advanced topics even if you explain very well."
"I do appreciate the effort Max puts into these videos but I feel there is to many references to ""there"", ""here"" without clearly showing or saying what ""there"" and ""here"" is. Also, in some occasions there is fast scrolling up and down that is next to impossible to track and follow.

To many ""of course"", ""and there"", ""and then"" and explanations sometimes get tangled without any reason. In addition, better structuring the course would help, using git repo that is properly organized to track Max's progress would help rather than downloading zip files."
"Probably the best course about Angular fundamentals and some advanced concepts on Udemy. Everything is explained in relatively clear way. There are also many opportunities to practice, in order to improve memorization of new knowledge. What I especially liked about course is that Maximilian tried to show variety of options and tools at our disposal to resolve the problems (e.g. Services vs RxJs). Due to that, I am definitely looking forward to take part in other courses (e.g. Vue.js, Node.js, advanced Javascript)."
"Very detailed, almost covered all area's of Angular. This is great head-start in web development world"
"From components to forms, pipes, routing, modules, and even more complex subjects like including redux, you will learn how to work with a challenging framework from zero. Maximilian takes you from the very base of a new project and introduces new concepts and mechanics along the course until you end knowing how to create a new app from scratch and make it grow in a smart way using a lot of the framework's tools.

Thanks to Maximilian's extensive knowledge and patience to explain every concept, I was able to work on a freelance project in a matter of weeks of study and to work on a challenging project at the end of the course.

If you want to truly understand how angular works, go for this course."
"Really really nice course, i begun without big idea about this. I'd like that in future section if possible, the base project be updated to the last version of angular. I really enjoyed this course! Nice teacher, nice expert!"
"It's a great course amazing, and your explanation is so clear. I hope you can prepare a new angular course such as a course which teaches us how to build e-commence shopping website by angular and firebase."
"I'm revisiting the course, and found it's as useful as it was the first time I went through it!!"
"Thank you Max for this nice video tutorial.

One suggestion which I would like to give is, through out the video, whenever we have errors while implementing any code, you directly mentioned what the problem with the code is.

It would be great if you would explain, how you found out what the problem is (may be debugging or just having a glance at the error)

For a novice like me, it would be of great help."
"Really good course, well explained and he even update the material according to the Angular version, which gives him a plus."
"The instructor played his role really well. In the beginning, I have no idea how to study and work with Angular as well. The instructor separated everything into small problems and solve it step by step. It is really useful for anyone who wants to work in Front-End or just repair for an interview."
"Max moves quickly and at times it's like drinking from the fire hose. If you are patient though, and are ok with not getting everything the first go-round, you can gain a lot from his teaching style."
"Pretty solid course, Max, as always knows how to tackle all the difficult parts. I highly recommend this course, because at least for me, it serves as a good guide whenever I need to revisit some concepts"
"I hope the course is more shorter, it takes time for me to finish."
"Max has a great teaching style, and really goes in depth into the key areas of Angular. The module on routing is especially good (routing in Angular is tough to dive into if you are not familiar with the concepts). Any questions are answered right away and there is a nice history of answered questions since this is such a popular course. Max starts off teaching how to do things in a way that is not best practice, and then rewrites the app with the best practice later on to teach the advantages of the best practice. An example of this is using event emitters vs subjects. For this reason, if you going to use this course to build your own Angular app I recommend getting a good ways into the course before you start coding."
"I studied many Angular courses,

and I believe Maximilian Schwarzmüller is one of the Best Teachers so far."
"It is one, if not the, best of Angular courses i've ever seen. This course, added to the one on Node and the mean stack, and Angular using a JS backend will never have secrets to you anymore. Thank you! Keep going providing us some good teaching Max! :)"
"While enrolling this course, i didn't have any prior experience to Angular. This course helped me to understand the Core Concepts of Angular from scratch and especially it was well paced with hands-on practice assignments. Thank you so much for such a wonderful course. Worth of every single minute invested. This will definitely help all aspiring Web developers.

Great Learning :-) Thank You Mr Max Schwarzmuller"
"Outstanding course on Udemy. Tutor have deep knowledge and way of explaining is also very easy to understand as tutor's more focus is on hands on experience while learning. Content quality is also very good and best part is, proving assignments to students between the course makes it worth learning."
It was a great learning experience. I was able to follow the lecture at every step and had got help via Q&A section from the instructor when ever needed. Over all very satisfied with the course structure and explanation.
"This was really useful for me to join to the Angular world. I could able find answers to most of the questions walking around in my mind. That I feel myself comfortable to start new adventures with Angular ship!

About the Max and his teaching style, I came here from the Youtube. first I have met with him on the youtube channel during my research which is the another useful source from him. He explains the modules from zero to all necessary details to really understand the subject. Then you can learn the way how to put more over this according to your requirements. Only think that might be that (not always but sometimes) When he is focusing to code to deliver working examples, it is not easy to catch him. Better to wait until he is done and replay this phases to understand better. I have already booked seats from his other useful courses to me to improve myself.

Highly recommended from my side.

Thanks for all your (w/team) efforts.

Best wishes"
"Undoubtedly, the most comprehensive Angular course on offer. Learnt a lot. Thanks Max !"
I am really blessed to find this course with Max as a tutor. You are really awesome Max. You make learning so easy and interactive. I really had the fear if I could learn angular. But taking up your course changes everything. Thanks a ton. :) :)
It was a course that I was afraid to take but I needed it to develop a project that was assigned to me at my work. This course really helped me a lot and appreciate Angular in another level. I have loved PHP for years but when I learned Angular I have now the knowledge to separate the backend and frontend development of a project that which is a good practice so that it could be used to other devices with only one source code. I would like to say thank you to the Teacher because he really helped me understand every detail of Angular and he guided me how to develop the project that I need for work even though I'm just a beginner. Now at work sometimes they treat me as a Master in Angular development... sometimes only :D
little bit difficult to understand if you don't have prior knowledge of html and css. You can add theory also . It will help us to understand better about component directive and everything else.
"Course Was amazing ,instructor provided lots of hand on.

very much useful and knowledgeable course"
"plus point here is, Explaining concepts with project

gives a note which is Need to remember always,

gives answers of what? why? how?"
Great couse to learn.I love his teaching skills
"Everything in the course was very helpful and amazing except a couple of things like -

- Ngrx section teaches the old style of implementing which I believe should be updated.

- Some content of the course might need re-arrangement, for example if the small introduction to typescript was in the starting and not in t the end I believe it would have been more easier to get along the course"
Great course to get an understanding of Angular and what it does behind the scenes. I liked how the we kept going back to the course project to apply the theories just learnt. But also how the project was improved as we went along. Would recommend!
"This course was very well structured, thought through and interesting. I've been using Angular for 2 years now and I still managed to learn a few new things. I highly recommend this course to beginners, as well as more advanced users (you'll still learn a things or two). The addition of NgRx and Firebase was a cherry on the top."
"This course is very nice. One finding. It is missing how Angular works on multi user scenario. What if two users load the shopping list page. How it differentiates each user's data. There is a small course module about cookies, but it explains about how to maintain the data in user browser. There is a course about session, but that is between angular server and backend (firebase). What if the page we are loading is not pulling the data from backend, instead using the already created objects.

There could have been a module about handle multiple users. Other than that, this course is awesome."
"The course is greatly explained (I have no problem with pronunciation, rather I always put Max at speed of 1.25~1.75). However, I deduct some points due some assignments/files used different version of angular (not updated to same version)."
An excellent course exploring all the possibilities of Angular. The course is logically divided into parts and constantly updated. I sincerely recommend!
"Thanks Max for a comprehensive, well structured and well taught course. Coming from a Java background, this course gave me all that I needed to develop a front end project on my own."
"Coming from a moderate background in web development of HTML, Javascript, and CSS, as well as a little React experience, I felt that this course would be a good learning experience. From the beginning Max taught the course in a very understandable way, and I found I was able to follow along for the most part very easily. There were a few parts where the Javascript syntax got very complex, but again it was explained well. I now feel confident in building my own Angular apps, being able to pull parts from the course project worked on throughout the course."
"I'm absolutely loving this course. So smooth, so well structured. Lovely assignments and a great project to work on. Making use of this knowledge in my workplace and also teaching them in parallel about what I'm learning everyday. Thank you so much MAX!!! God bless you! :D"
"It's a pretty clear course but I disagree that you don't need some knowledge experience with typescript, html and ccs."
"Complete course, which covers everything about Angular!"
"I like this course very much so far. Till Section 6 I have completed. And able to make the project with good UI and components data passing, various Data binding, and making it to life as a working application.

Adding Details on Section 18 now, learned about Forms, Observables, Pipes various things which I was not aware of before. Now learning HTTP Module for Sending various HTTP verb Requests. Awesome I am enjoying this Video Training, learning a lot of things from it.

Finally, I have completed this course, with everyday efforts of 1 Hr each day for about 45 days, as was trying to do the examples along with the videos, pausing in between, and spending time on exercises over the weekends.

Completed, so Happy."
"Very good course , all tipics are very well covered , i use it to review basics and improve skills, learned a lot of new things."
"Yes, This course is amazing, learn a lot of basic and advanced things . And Provide additional bonus part to help increase knowledge and learn more. Thanks..."
"Very good course that gives a great foundation in beginning Angular. I followed along using Angular 10 and used Bootstrap 4.5.2 - it is a shame the videos have not been completely updated but it is understandable as to why (there is a lot of videos to re-record...).

I thought the Directives and Routing modules could have done with a separate assignment task like most other modules to really drive home what was learnt in that module."
"The best Angular course to learn, the instructor Max is a amazing man and tries to explain things in alien level. Thank you Max for teaching and inspiring me :)"
"Great course for that people who know nothing about developing and angular.

Big thank, for this course."
"this course was simply amazing it is indeed a complete guide as Max said , he is absolutely amazing instructor with an amazing abilities to deliver and explain information about the subject , and really get into details that matter and gives the students exactly what they need , i highly command this course....

thanx Max, your course really helped a lot"
"Best course for Angular devlopment, covers many topics related to Angular encountered from setting up the app till deployment (that was bonus for me). Also, liked his style of teaching, was a fan of him from his YouTube channel (Academind)."
"It help me a lot to improved my logics and to solve the errors.....

Thank you....."
This is an outstanding course. The way he builds it up from basic Angular to incorporating all of the various facets of Angular is clear and concise. Well worth taking.
I learned a lot about angular and the basic of how angular works. I am now able to implement these knowledge into actions. The instructor gives a lot of scenarios of how and when to use. The instructor goes in thorough details of what's happening behind the scene when using this framework. I enjoyed this course.
Maximilian is an excellent teacher and I now understand Angular better than ever !
"This is really an Amazing course to learn about Angular from nowhere to somewhere. I will recommend this course to others. There is so much into Angular and this course is the best start.

Having gone through this course, I wish I should have gone through some of the Advance Javascript stuff to ave thorough understanding.

I wish there was more stuff related to RxJS in this course.

Having said that, this course is still the best. Thank you so much Max !

Looking forward to your next course :)"
"I frequently take refreshing courses on Angular, this is the best so far because of the following:

1- the sequence of which the material is organized makes the best sense, you will reach the ""Aha"" points as you progress in the course which give a deeper better understanding of the concepts.

2- The course covers topics more than any other course and looks like it kept up to date.

3- all the code works and if there is a bug you will find a note on why it is generated and how to fix it.

4- The instructor is talented in communicating the information from his brain to yours in an easy and smooth manner.

5- You always have to shift gears between learning a topic and then course project application, going back and forth really helps you getting better hands on the concepts.

6- The Course project starts primitive (but working!) and keeps evolving with each new concept.

7- The course is utilizing firebase as a back end for the http module, which is a very convenient way to have a ready easy to configure set of completely working API for persisting and fetching your data, it just like when you are working in a real enterprise app development environment.

If there is one downside of the course, i would say it makes you HUNGRY with all the schnitzel and Hamburger in the course project... so... be careful dont gain weight :)"
"so bad,say lot of void unuseful word, I donnot know what he said, no example, can not pick up emphasis, waste time, do not know the real practice"
It is a very good course.The only hard thing was getting used Max's way of teaching.Sometimes he use very advanced syntax and it is hard to follow
"Another excellent course by Max. Really detailed, up to the point and updated, so all the presented code works as expected."
Every part of Angular is explained very well and the amount of detail is impressive. I particularly enjoy the additional information that expands my knowledge of web development further than just learning a new framework. The details provided are beyond what is needed to understand Angular but are appreciated.
"Max is hands down one of the best instructors I have followed here at Udemy. This course is no exception, excellent content and update goodies all the time!"
There should have been some hands on experience on Web API included in this course as a bonus as most Angular developers makes http calls to Web API. And as an angular course this covers most of the topics
"I am deeply impressed by the way the course is structured to cover not only the basic concepts of Angular but also the several accompanying features making Angular a truly comprehensive platform. Emphasis on updating the course content regularly allows learners to follow relevant content. Course project along with assignments play an integral role in solidifying the concepts learnt throughout. Although long, I have enjoyed learning thoroughly and I would recommend the course to any interested learner for an amazing journey with Max."
High quality. Useful resources. In depth explanation of features. Broad topics. Can recommend!
"Very good! congratulations. I just think you should provide a bit more details regarding subjcts like Emmitters, subscriptions which in my opion is a key feature for understanding other parts of this course. Anyway, in general, the content, the explantions are perfect."
"easy to follow; the progress is fast enough, which has the advantage of not wasting time unnecessarily; where I need more time I simply pause the stream

actually I need to pause the stream quite often…

practizing the material is very important, otherwise you would have forgotten some parts learnt near the beginning of the course when reaching the end, I am suspecting…

Having finished all sections: The sections are a place to come back to and look up how it works when sometimes in the future the need to apply some technique comes up."
"This is the best of all the courses that I have taken.Max is just amazing.He has covered everything that we need to work on Angular.I had zero knowledge on Angular before taking up this course.But now, I can work on it with no struggle.Thank you Max for this beautiful course.I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn Angular"
it's realy awesome. but the only problem that i have is the speed of speeking. since i'm not english it's sometimes too hard to understand. but in total it's perfect
Very good professor and taught all concepts step by step and easily understandable. I love this Course veryyyyyyyyyyy much..........
Instructor have very good understanding of the Angular framework. Everything is explained by the instructor in full details. I strongly recommend this course to anyone who want to start learning Angular framework.
"I have immensely enjoyed this course. I started this course without knowing what was in store, and now I feel I do have a solid standing on the subject.

Thanks Max."
"If you want to know web development, go to Max. I took multiple courses. All of them, including this one, were fantastic. Thank you Max!"
"Yea, max was really good in his explainations and hit on the key points that you should know about angular"
"Filled with lots of useful information. Good job on the course. I learned so much that I got a job. Sometimes he goes a little fast, but its really data packed.

Update: All the information and skills I gain here I go and put it to use at work, and thus my ROI for this course is above 100%. Best investment ever. In history. Ever.

Update On Finishing: Some modules can be long and boring, and maybe I wont use those tools at work. But they provide extra information which is useful in the future. It gives you an entire toolset which you can use.

Good job Max. One last thing for these Typescript videos you need to get your other regular mic out and speak into it. Other than that good course. Definitely good value for what I paid."
its a god explonation .i love this course so far as now.
"It was really worth buying this course, I learned a lot of new things from this course. I have no objections, the professor is very well understood during the explanation in the video. It is worth buying this course, I am sure you will learn new things."
"Great instructor, he knows how to easily explain concepts, very clear and complete. He covered a lot of topics and provided their exercises. I've learned Angular in an easy way thanks to Mark, so good job."
"step by step, well designed course project, but some legacy videos are quite boring at the end since they are not hands on"
Instructor is pretty easy to follow. Just make sure you have the bootstrap documentation handy to be able to replicate some of the assignments/follow along with lectures. The bootstrap move from v3 to v4 has made a material amount of the styling classes obsolete.
"Very awesome course! This is the course I always recommend to my friends and co-workers who wish to learn Angular. By the end of it I was pretty comfortable with the framework and I had an easy time understanding official docs of Angular, Angular Material etc. or other resources related to more advanced topics."
one word Fabulous ...!! Most fascinating fact about this course is tutor keep updating it with latest angular version.
Most comprehensive course about angular on udemy. It's actually a bit too much details sometimes but better be safe than sorry. Thanks Max and team for the time invested in creating this course. Great investment.
"great course, but i would find it easier to follow if variable names were less confusing. example subscription: Subscription could be mySubscription: Subscription. router: Router could be myRouter: Router.

This would make it much easier to follow/quick read at the pace of the course."
"After about 20 hours of listening the pronunciation sometimes got to me a bit, other than that the explanation and course material were great."
"Yes, am lucky that I enroll for this course. Nice explanation of each and every topic. I am very happy with this course."
"Max is a good teacher, but he didn't prepare this course well. Lots of Angular theory knowledge is introduced by saying. What I expect is some powerpoint or animation to explain each topic of Angular before we actually develop a project.

This course use lots of RxJS., although the introduction of this source say it has no requirement of Rxjs, I recommend that you should learn RxJS before take this course. When Max use operator of RxJS, he just explain that specific operator. It it hard to connect those operator to Angular.

I also recommend you have foundation knowledge of html and css to take this course."
"Truly a great course that gave me a chance to learn a lot and I recommend this course to all my friends.....!!!!! I enjoyed learning Angular and without having any background in the concepts taught in the course, I was able to catch things so fast and things seemed so easy. Thank You Max for this Amazing Course.....!!!!!"
"It was a nice course, I ended up building a workspace after the third app so maybe some topics of the Angular CLI module would be good before actually build the apps, nonetheless I really enjoyed the course, the way the topics are arranged and the timing of it. Thank you Max!"
Very helpful course for beginners and Intermediates
"Instructor speaks very clearly. The course contains a lot of contents, including a lot of bonus materials."
"this course is great , but if i could add something to it , it would be a way to watch at the coding in different files at the same time ... like the ts file and the html file at the same time , because it's difficult to follow up when you jumping from one file to the others..."
"Very good course. The instruction is given fast, but the instructor encourages pausing the video. On top of that, I can replay video segments I don't fully understand. I have a better understanding of Angular 2 and plan to use what I've learned."
"Wow, this course was quite the ride! I really enjoyed it! I managed to finish it in about 100.5 hours meaning a ratio of 1 hour of video takes 3 real time hours. (currently the course has 33.5h). A big thank you to Max for this awesome course and to Jost how was actively answering course questions ^_^."
"Definitely a very good course. I understood most of the concepts. It will be a huge help for my project.

I took the notes of every word said by Max."
"I needed to learn Angular for a new project I was assigned at at work and this course from Max was really helpful.

He is one of the best communicators I have found online for developing purposes."
"It was a deep dive to angular world, Max has thoroughly curated the course to cover every bit and concept of Angular"
This is great training i have ever attended with lots of hands on. Very easy to understand. It was a nightmare for me when I think about Angular. But now I would say I could design Angular Application based on the requirements. Thanks to the tutor.
"Updated review. I am leaving my original review so others can see that initially this course and Max can be daunting. This my first time using bootstrap and Angular.

After gaining some experience in HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, and Angular I found Max and this course invaluable. An amazing amount of material is covered in this course, and will take some time to digest. I promise you will use this as a reference once you begin creating your own apps.

I highly recommend this course, with the caveat you should have some experience in the material that is being covered.

While the instructor has an amazing grasp of the subject matter, he needs to slow down the revisions to code. The constant back and forth refactoring of code is extremely frustrating to follow. This becomes most apparent during the ngrx portion of the class."
